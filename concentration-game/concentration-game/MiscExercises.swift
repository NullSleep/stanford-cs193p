        // MARK: Computed properties
        // The value of a property can be computed rahter than stored
        // A typical property looks somehting like this:
//        var foo: Double
        // A computed property looks like this:
//        var foo: Double {
//            get {
//                // Return the calculated value of foo
//            }
//            set(newValue) {
//                // do somehting based on the fact that foo has changed to newValue
//            }
//        }
        // It is not necesary to implement the set (the property then becomes read only
        
        // IMPORTANT:
        // Foo is never stored anywhere instead everytime someone asks for foo it gets calculated with the
        // code inside get. And everytime someone set the value of foo the code inside set gets executed.
        // Why are they important? What do you use them for?
        // A lot of time many properties are derived from other states inside the struct, so you don't
        // want duplicated information that can get out of sync. So it is better to derive the information.
        
        // Keeping up this var up-to-date is just plain error-prone.
//        var indexOfOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard: Int?
        // This is safer
//        var indexOfOneAndOnlyFaceUpCard: Int? {
//            get {
//                // Look at all the cards and see if you find only one that's face up if so, return it,
//                // else return nil
//            }
//            set {
//                // Turn all the cards face down except the card at index newValue
//            }
//        }
